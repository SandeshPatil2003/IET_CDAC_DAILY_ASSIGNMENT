To use your settings.xml file to ensure Maven works correctly within Eclipse, particularly with proxy settings, you need to point Eclipse to the specific location of this file in its preferences. 
Step-by-Step Guide
Place the settings.xml file
First, ensure the settings.xml file is saved in a permanent location on your computer. The standard location is in the .m2 directory within your user home directory (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\.m2\settings.xml on Windows or ~/.m2/settings.xml on macOS/Linux). If the .m2 folder or file doesn't exist, create them.
Configure Eclipse Maven User Settings
Next, tell Eclipse to use this specific configuration file:
Open Eclipse.
Go to Window > Preferences.
In the Preferences window, expand the Maven section on the left sidebar.
Click on User Settings.
In the "User Settings" field, you will see a default path. Use the Browse button to navigate to and select the settings.xml file you placed in the .m2 folder in Step 1.
Once the correct path is displayed, click the Update Settings button. Eclipse will reload the Maven settings and show the "Local Repository" path which it has detected from your settings.xml file.
Apply Settings to Projects
After configuring the global preferences, you may need to update your projects for the changes to take full effect:
Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer.
Select Maven > Update Project....
In the dialog box that appears, you can optionally check the box for "Force Update of Snapshots/Releases" (sometimes necessary to resolve stubborn connection issues) and click OK.
Restart Eclipse (if necessary)
While clicking "Update Settings" should work, some complex network configurations might require a full restart of Eclipse for the changes to be fully incorporated. 
By following these steps, Eclipse's embedded Maven will correctly pick up the proxy configuration defined in your settings.xml file, allowing it to download dependencies and work properly within your network environment.
